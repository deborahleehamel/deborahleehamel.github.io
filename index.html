<div class="intro">
  Hi, I'm Deb.<br />
  I am more interested in people than stuff.<br />
  I am currently studying full-stack web development at Turing.<br />
  I want to make things that are useful and meaningful to people.<br />
  I appreciate the city and wilderness.<br />
  I wish the world was a kinder and more interesting place for everyone.
