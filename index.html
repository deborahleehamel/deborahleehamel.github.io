<div class="intro">
  Hi, I'm Deb.<br />
  I am more interested in people than stuff.<br />
  I am studying full-stack web development at Turing.<br />
  I like wilderness and big skies.<br />
  I am a dog person, but I don't have a dog.<br />
  I wish the world was a kinder and more interesting place for everyone.
