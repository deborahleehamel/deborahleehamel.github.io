  Hi, I'm Deb.<br />
  I think people are more interesting than material stuff.<br />
  I am currently studying full-stack web development at <a href="https://www.turing.io/" style="text-decoration: underline;">Turing</a>.<br />
  I want to make things that are useful and valuable to people.<br />
  I am grateful for big cities and the wilderness.<br />
  I wish the world was a kinder and more interesting place for everyone.<br />
  Be brave and enjoy life!
